Furever is a Ruby on Rails based pet adoption website.

There are three databases running all with CRUD systems setup. One for Users which includes Session controllers, password authentication and encryption using the Ruby Gem bcrypt.

-One for Users who have a HABTM relationship with animals which they can save to a list of favorites.
-One for animals, who have a HABTM relationship with users.
-And finally one for shelters which have a "has many" relationship with animals.

The CSS styling is done primarily with Bootstrap.

Photos are hosted by Cloudinary and are uploadable to user profiles as well as to animal show pages.
